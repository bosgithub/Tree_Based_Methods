# Tree_Based_Methods

*__Tree based method__* is one of the most popular tools to use in the field of data science. It can be used for both *regression* as well as for *classification* tasks. It is the algorithmic backbone for libraries such as XGBoost, which continue to outperform other DL methods on various Kaggle competitions.

### Let's see how it works.

#### Tree methods works by straifying or segmenting the predictor space into a number of smaller regions or smaller subspace

With any given dataset, we have X1, X2, ....., Xp. The set of predictors, which generate a predictor space with p predictors/features. This can be represented by a rank p tensor. 

*an example for this would be maping displacement with respect to time on a cartesian coordinate system, where as time progresses, we can traverse within the x, y, and z axises defined space, each of which tells us the unique information of our location along the specific axis or predictor.*
